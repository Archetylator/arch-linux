# Arch Linux Installation Script

It is a script used by me to speed up an installation process. 
The script installs a minimal Arch operating system with LVM on LUKS :lock: with dm-crypt.
Works only with UEFI systems. 

To use a script you may execute the following command:

`sh -c "$(curl --location --silent https://goo.gl/ptUyx8)"`
